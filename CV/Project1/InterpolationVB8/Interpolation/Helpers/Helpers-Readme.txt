Helpers contains stuff I use in several projects.
For that its not 100% appropriate to the InterpolVB8-Project.
And its worse commented than the other project-items.

The Extension-Helpers are rests of much more Extension-functions I use, when I code in VB9.
Of course they are no longer Extension-Functions.
